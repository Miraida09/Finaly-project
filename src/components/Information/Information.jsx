                        Absolutely beautiful. My niece was ecstatic with how  <br />beautiful her bouquet is. She has shared photos with me & <br /> mum & we are over the moon. You are amazing 🤩 You have <br /> a wonderful talent. Thank you, thank you, thank you. <br />
                        I will be telling all my friends & family about you 💖

                        Anna I just want to say a huge thank you for making my <br /> sister feel special. Your arrangement was simply stunning <br /> and the perfect gift for this occasion. You did an amazing <br /> job. I will certainly keep your details to use in the future. My <br /> daughter is having her first baby (boy) in a few months time <br /> so that might be my next occasion!
                        Thanking you, Clare
